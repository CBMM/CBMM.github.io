                    <p><a href="./posts/2016-01-13-opening-up-your-research-day-3.html">Last time</a>, we discussed some austere topics around blocking and asynchronous execution, and we may have started to feel like insurmountable piles of jargon stand between us and a working site, while our page still consists of just ugly input boxes and 90’s-looking text labels. Today we’ll let our <a href="https://www.braindecoder.com/neil-degrasse-tyson-elegantly-debunk-right-left-brain-myth-1120713524.html">right brain</a> have some more fun.</p>
<p>We can start with paper and pencil. Dry-erase boards are great too, because we have some colored markers to work with, and the thick lines are nicer to look at.</p>
<p>Imagine your page, and take your time to draw what you see. Like writing<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, drawing a draft forces a level of concreteness to your idea that can’t be gotten through imagination alone<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. This isn’t just about the design - it’s also about discovering features.</p>

            <p>
                
                    <p>In our <a href="./posts/2016-01-12-opening-up-your-research-day-2.html">last lecture</a> we set up a server to call one of several shell commands depending the URL. I wouldn’t recommend just rereading those posts in order to start web programming - instead you should refer to the very good documentation released with a web framework like <a href="http://snapframework.com">Snap</a> or <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask</a>. When you get some familiarity with the languages used (<a href="http://haskell.org">Haskell</a> and <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a> respectively), then the details in our code samples will begin to make more sense.</p>
<h1 id="direct-library-calls-vs.shell-commands">Direct library calls vs. shell commands</h1>
<p>The servers we built were language agnostic. They can call any program you have installed on your system, passing arguments through the command line. Sometimes we can trade away language agnosticism for convenience and code quality. For example, if the scientific application is written in Python, and our server is written in Python, then instead of using a <code>process</code> library to call out to the shell, we can invoke our scientific function directly from the Flask handler.</p>

                    <p><a href="http://web.mit.edu/iap">IAP</a> can giveth, and IAP can taketh away. My bustling class of five has dropped by three and picked up one new student, then lost another. But hope is not lost. We may have a real project to work on. Our student from <a href="http://chemistry.mit.edu">chemistry</a> works on a very active Python codebase called the <a href="https://reactionmechanismgenerator.github.io">Reaction Mechanism Generator</a>.</p>
<p>Useful as it is, installing the dependencies has apparently been hard enough to limit adoption, so we want to expose some of its functionality through a web interface. Just what I had in mind for our class! We’ll dedicate our three remaining sessions to this, hope that it benefits the Reaction Mechanism Generator project, and then see if the skills we learn spill over into other projects.</p>
<h1 id="servers">Servers</h1>
<p>On <a href="./posts/2016-01-11-opening-up-your-research-day-1.html">Day 1</a> we talked about static assets like <code>.html</code> files, <code>.css</code> files, <code>.js</code> scripts, and images. When the all we need to do is deliver these files to a user, we don’t have to handle writing any code to serve the files; we can just find a static hosting services like <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3">Amazon S3</a>.</p>
<p>But that was a whole day ago, and today we want more.</p>

                    <p>Day 1 of <a href="http://student.mit.edu/searchiap/iap-9289af8f51100344015126e75301021d.html">Opening your Research</a> was a big hit! Five people showed up. Three of them are young grad students. One is an MIT alum from the class of ’77, who took <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/phw/">Patrick Winston</a>’s (my dear boss) first <a href="https://ai6034.mit.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page">Intro to Artificial Intelligence</a> class. And finally there was an MIT alum in his 40’s who holds some of the early wind-energy patents. Great group! I’m disappointed that the ’77 alum won’t be sticking around, but the remainder sound like they will be here for the week. That’s enough time for us to get some things done.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the goals I write down earlier today and see if we met them.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Start collaborative relationships with at least a few students interested in giving their research an online presence.</li>
<li>Give everyone enough confidence to continue learning and implement their own data/tool-sharing when they’re ready</li>
</ul>

                    <p>Today was the last of three one-day sessions on <a href="https://git-scm.com">git</a> and <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> (<a href="http://student.mit.edu/searchiap/iap-9289af8f51100344015126db3107020f.html">here</a> is the course description). Next week I’ll lead a one-week course called <a href="http://student.mit.edu/searchiap/iap-9289af8f51100344015126e75301021d.html">Opening up your research to the web</a>.</p>
<p>We had 18 students in total, most coming for just a single 1.5 hour session. Students’ ages were anywhere from 17 to 60, with the elder ones tending to be there to listen. The average reason for attending was more or less:</p>

                    <p>Here is the first post on the CBMM @ Github website. As explained on the <a href="./about.html">About</a> page, we wanted a space to organize the open-source activity going on at the <a href="http://cbmm.mit.edu">CBMM</a>, beyond just the wall of repositories on our github <a href="https://github.com/CBMM">org page</a>.</p>
<p>The design decisions reflect the broader universe of the CBMM software situation. The developer staff is small, and there are far more projects to do than people to do them. At the same time we want the site to be reliable to maintain and simple to edit with the same workflow that we use for developing software. We also want the development process to be totally <em>open</em>. So, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a> is an extremely good fit for hosting. We don’t have to do any maintenance or worry at all about backups. And the site content is generated mainly from <a href="http://commonmark.org/help/">markdown</a> via the fantastic document converter <a href="http://pandoc.org">pandoc</a> and static site generator <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll">Hakyll</a>.</p>
