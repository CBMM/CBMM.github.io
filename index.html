<p>Teaching the <a href="./posts/2016-01-08-iap-git-class.html">git introduction</a> showed me just how many micro-steps one has to take before feeling comfortable with basic coding and web technologies - it’s easy to forget that as you become comfortable yourself. In this class we might try to go way beyond just ‘get my project onto GitHub’. There’s some chance that either (a) there is no middle-ground where a researcher can learn enough about web tooling without sacrificing their research time, or (b) I won’t manage to lead the class to that middle-ground. That’s something to keep in mind as we start, and a good goal to keep coming back to.</p>

            <p>
                
                    <p>Today was the last of three one-day sessions on <a href="https://git-scm.com">git</a> and <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> (<a href="http://student.mit.edu/searchiap/iap-9289af8f51100344015126db3107020f.html">here</a> is the course description). Next week I’ll lead a one-week course called <a href="http://student.mit.edu/searchiap/iap-9289af8f51100344015126e75301021d.html">Opening up your research to the web</a>.</p>
<p>We had 18 students in total, most coming for just a single 1.5 hour session. Students’ ages were anywhere from 17 to 60, with the elder ones tending to be there to listen. The average reason for attending was more or less:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our lab started using some software that’s hosted on github, and I’m confused about how to keep track of different versions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My goal in the class was to give students some muscle memory for working with git and GitHub. So I only lectured at the board for 5 minutes or so, then we immediately jumped in to exercises - namely cloning and contributing to a fake repository I set up at <a href="https://github.com/imalsogreg/gitdemo" class="uri">https://github.com/imalsogreg/gitdemo</a>.</p>
<p>Students forked this repository to their own GitHub accounts (perhaps one still exists <a href="https://github.com/yunboyer/gitdemo">here</a>?), and each cloned the repository to their laptop, made a change, pushed their work back to github, and then issued pull requests to me. I integrated each pull request back into the original <code>gitdemo</code> repository in turn. Sometimes the merges were successful. Other times, one student’s work being integrated into the central repository would conflict with the merge of a later student’s work, so we got to see how merge conflicts are resolved.</p>
<p>It takes a lot more than a couple of hours to get used to version control, learning the jargon, and grasping which aspects of git are mandatory and which are just parts of workflow convention. But I think the students all came away with a very solid grasp of the basics and how to move forward. All in all, for git I really like the interactive format.</p>
<p>There are lots of online guides to git, particularly good ones are <a href="https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1">try.github.io</a> and <a href="https://git-scm.com/doc">git-scm.com</a>.</p>

                    <p>Here is the first post on the CBMM @ Github website. As explained on the <a href="./about.html">About</a> page, we wanted a space to organize the open-source activity going on at the <a href="http://cbmm.mit.edu">CBMM</a>, beyond just the wall of repositories on our github <a href="https://github.com/CBMM">org page</a>.</p>
<p>The design decisions reflect the broader universe of the CBMM software situation. The developer staff is small, and there are far more projects to do than people to do them. At the same time we want the site to be reliable to maintain and simple to edit with the same workflow that we use for developing software. We also want the development process to be totally <em>open</em>. So, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a> is an extremely good fit for hosting. We don’t have to do any maintenance or worry at all about backups. And the site content is generated mainly from <a href="http://commonmark.org/help/">markdown</a> via the fantastic document converter <a href="http://pandoc.org">pandoc</a> and static site generator <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll">Hakyll</a>.</p>
