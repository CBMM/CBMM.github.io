title: Get your social fix through coding

If you haven't registered for an account on [twitter](http://www.twitter.com) or [reddit](http://www.reddit.com), don't make one now. These sites have serious addictive power. For most of us on Facebook, you're in one of two camps. Either posting a comment is a rare event, and you refresh your post through the day checking whether your friends Like'd your idea or ignored it. *Or* you've posted enough that you desensitized to the feedback you could get on any one comment. Either way, when you powerful draw of shouting into the void, you understand the power the void has over you as you listen for its response, whether it's cat pictures, politics or science policy.

Something I found surprising is that contributing open source code can feel exactly the same way. Maybe you're *not* on twitter, but you already have a pretty accurate idea of what sort of experience you would have there, given your experience on Facebook. But you might not have guessed that this is the feeling that come with a [Github](http://www.github.com) account.

  <$foldboxTitle>GitWhat?</foldboxTitle>
  <$foldboxContent>[Github](http://www.github.com) is a website for storing your collections of source code under version control, on the surface. It provides tools that make it easy to copy versions of your own code or other people's code, make experimental changes, and perhaps get those experimental changes integrated into the other people's copies.

When people first hear of open source, they often think, 'If everyone can change the code freely, what prevents random people from arbitrarily making bad changes?' The answer is: the code doesn't live in a single place where everyone has write-access. Instead everyone is free to copy and change the code, and for popular programs, there is one commonly known 'primary owner' of the code. He or she may put the code on their personal website, or on a shared website like [SourceForge](http://www.sourceforge.com).

That answers the first question, but it raises a host of others. *How do people know who the 'primary owner' of their program is (for programs that don't come in plastic-wrapped boxes)?* For a long time, you had to figure that out by knowing people, subscribing to mailing lists, or by judging how professional-looking the website is. If that sounds inefficient and error-prone, well... it is. *Ok. If code copies are owned by individuals, how does the owner benefit from the work of other people on those independent copies?* Would you believe, mostly through e-mail? It's not quite *that* barbaric - there are programs that will read the original source code and a new version, then generate a report of which lines have changed. And there are complementary programs that look at the original code and the change report, and update the old code via the change report. If a contributor thinks their contribution is useful and should be merged into the owner's code, the contributor e-mails the patch to the main owner, and the owner applies it to their code. This is largely how open source software was written before Github got popular (let's say, around 2010? TODO).

There aren't rules in basketball about man-to-man or zone coverage. There are rules about how much you're allowed to hold the ball while dribbling, how large the court is, etc - man-to-man and zone coverage are patterns that evolve around those rules. The same kind of relationship exits between the tools available to programmers and the patterns of collaboration that can evolve around those tools. And this is Github's main contribution. The Github website makes it easier to copy code, share changes, track bugs, track fixes and vote on the quality of code bases. Those tools are nice, but the more exciting part is the community that evolved around Github because of those tools.

The [Github](http://www.github.com) website use to run with the banner "Social Coding"[1], which I found a little strange when getting started, especially since there was no wall of comments... *Um, what kind of socializing is going on here exactly?*
